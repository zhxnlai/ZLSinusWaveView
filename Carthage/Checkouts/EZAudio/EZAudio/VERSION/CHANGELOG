==========================================================================================

0.0.1
Initial release. 
Components include: EZAudioFile, EZAudioPlot, EZAudioPlotGL, EZMicrophone, EZOutput, and EZRecorder. 
Provided 6 example projects: CoreGraphicsWaveform, OpenGLWaveform, WaveformFromFile, PassThrough, Record, and PlayFile.

0.0.2
Fix for Cocoapod spec. Forgot to include files with .c extension.

0.0.3 
Changing EZAudioPlot and EZAudioPlotGL to scroll for the EZPlotTypeRolling instead of wiping the screen clean when hitting the end
Allowed EZMicrophone EZOutput to have custom AudioStreamBasicDescription setters
Fixed bug in EZAudioFile's getWaveformData function where it was not exiting after sending back cached waveform data (rereading from the audio file)
Added stereo support for EZMicrophone, EZAudioFile, EZRecorder, and EZOutput
Added more memory cleanup for EZAudioFile
Added adjustable rolling length for EZAudioPlot and EZAudioPlotGL so those rolling graphs can now range from 128 to 8192 whereas before it was fixed at 1024
Added adjustable resolution for waveform data coming from the EZAudioFile so output from the getWaveformDataWithCompletionBlock: function can literally be of any size. Try 128 for a low resolution waveform or 8192 for a much higher resolution waveform.
Added quick fix for EZOutput to properly route stereo data coming from a circular buffer datasource. Next version (0.0.4) needs to add EZConverter to allow quick conversions between non-interleaved and interleaved formats.

0.0.4
Added ‘closeAudioFile’ to EZRecorder to properly dispose of internal audio file prior to trying to reload it using the EZAudioFile.
Added new EZOutputDataSource method that provides pre-allocated AudioBufferList to fill instead of caller allocating and disposing on AudioBufferList. Much less errors.
Added EZAudioPlayer for playback and visualization of local audio files (no network streaming yet).
Merged bug fixes from community for EZAudio file. 

0.0.5
Added multiple destination recording formats to the EZRecorder (EZRecorderFileType)
